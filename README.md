# PROJECT NAME
	# Jquery-Server-Side-Calculator

## Description
_Duration: 4 Days_

Created a calculator that does basic funcitons like add, subtract, multiply and divide and stores the information on the server side. The information should then be retrieved from the server and posted to the DOM as a list of solutions.

The basic calculator takes in two inputs and a operator and once you hit = it sends the information to the server.

The stretch calculator looks and acts like a basic calculator that you have on you phone execpt you can create basic expressions before hitting enter.(ie. 4 + 5 * 7 / 8)
